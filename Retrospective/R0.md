# RETROSPECTIVE (Team 02)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
  - Commited: 4
  - Done: 3
- Total points committed vs. done
  - Commited: 11
  - Done: 10
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
  - Planned: 48h
  - Spent: 46h 15m

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):
  Hours est. per task average = 1,97h, standard deviation = 1,17h
  Hours actual per task average = 2,64h, standard deviation = 2,03h
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: -0.25

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: We estimated tickets globally (not per type of tasks)
  - Total hours spent: 1h 25m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 29
  - Coverage (if available):

| File           | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| All files      | 96.11   | 92.1     | 95.65   | 96.07   |
| dataService.js | 100     | 100      | 100     | 100     |
| routes.js      | 95.5    | 92.1     | 95.45   | 95.45   | 30,113,161,191    |
| server.js      | 100     | 100      | 100     | 100     |

- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated : We estimated tickets globally (not per type of tasks)
  - Total hours spent : 6h 25m
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated : We estimated tickets globally (not per type of tasks)
  - Total hours spent : 1h 45m

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - Tests took more than expected
  - Learning new technologies for some of the team members
  - Project clarity before development

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - Tests are time consuming
  - Development teams (front-end / back-end) were quite unbalanced
  - Tasks were poorly written
  - We learned how to collaborate using Git
  - We learned how to write better tests

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? (N.A)

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why? (N.A)

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two

  - We want to improve our general organization before starting development (better definition of tasks, data structures, apis, naming conventions)
  - We also want to improve code reviews and keep YouTrack updated more frequently

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  - We were available when someone needed help and in the end, we were quite happy with the final
